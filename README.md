# New React Project

> Built with ReactJS, Sass, Bootstrap, React Router...

## Development
* `npm install & bower install` to install dependencies. `gulp watch` to run development server. `gulp` to run tests and build.

## Rules

* Keep view-based logic in component files, but controller logic in separate files.
* TODOs should take the form `// TODO [<Name>, <Mo-Da-Year>] : <TODO Type> : <Comment>` where `<TODO Type> = BUG | ENHANCEMENT | IMPROVEMENT`
* Follow AirBnb JS Style Guide
