# New React Project

> Download and go. Save yourself a couple hours fighting with configuration bugs.

## What's in the Box
* Working React Router
* Opinionated Structure for Sass and React Components
* Automatically configured endpoints for development and production

## Development
* `npm install & bower install` to install dependencies. `gulp watch` to run development server. `gulp` to run tests and build
* Pop `http://localhost:3000/#/page/?pageNum=2` into your omnibar to check that the Router is working (needn't be `pageNum=2`). If not, make sure React-Router's peer-dependencies are up to date

## Suggestions

* TODOs should take the form `// TODO [<Name>, <Mo-Da-Year>] : <TODO Type> : <Comment>` where `<TODO Type> = BUG | ENHANCEMENT | IMPROVEMENT`
* Follow AirBnb JS Style Guide
